# Skeletor: a modern, modular UI ecosystem
Skeletor is a highly customizable family of UI build tools, created by the [DEG](http://www.degdigital.com) UI team. 

On its own, [Skeletor Core](https://github.com/deg-skeletor/skeletor-core) is just a task runner (albeit a very powerful and configurable task runner, if we do say so ourselves). But when combined with its robust plugin ecosystem and command line tools, Skeletor can easily handle the heavy lifting of almost any UI build process, including:

* Static site templating and generation
* CSS preprocessing
* JavaScript package management, transpilation, bundling and loading
* Image optimization
* Complex UI workflow and static asset management
* Local server/middleware creation
