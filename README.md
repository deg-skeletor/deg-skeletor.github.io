# Skeletor: modern, modular UI build tools
Skeletor is a highly customizable UI build tool and ecosystem, created by the [DEG](http://www.degdigital.com) UI team. 

On its own, [Skeletor Core](https://github.com/deg-skeletor/skeletor-core) is just the task runner of the bunch (albeit a very powerful and configurable one, if we do say so ourselves). But combined with its robust plugin ecosystem and command line tools, it can easily handle the heavy lifting of almost any UI build process, including:

* Static site templating and generation
* CSS preprocessing
* JavaScript package management, transpilation, bundling and loading
* Image optimization
* Complex UI workflow and static asset management
* Local server/middleware creation
