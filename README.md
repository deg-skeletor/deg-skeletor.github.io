# Skeletor: modern, modular UI build tools
Skeletor is a highly customizable UI build tool ecosystem, created by the [DEG](http://www.degdigital.com) UI team. 

On its own, [Skeletor Core](https://github.com/deg-skeletor/skeletor-core) is just the task runner of the bunch (albeit a very configurable one, if we do say so ourselves). When combined with its robust family of plugins and command line tools, it can easily handle the heavy lifting of almost any UI build process, including:

* Static site templating and generation
* CSS preprocessing
* JavaScript package management, transpilation, bundling and loading
* Image optimization
* Workflow and static asset management
* Local server/middleware creation
